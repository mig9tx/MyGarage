# MyGarage

Mobile application that allows user to keep their maintenance records and owned vehicle specs in their pocket.  They get alerts when 
maintenace is required, reminded when service is due, find a mechanic or service center nearby, view charts and graphs showing their maintenance and cost over time, and print out a detailed maintenance history when they sell their vehicle.

# Motivation

As a vehicle owner of mulitple manufacturer vehicles, it is difficult to keep the records of all of your cars in one place.  It is easy to misplace oil change forms or maintenance sheets.  It's great to keep all of the records in one place where one can reference the cost, service performed as well as get alerts of scheduled upcoming service.
